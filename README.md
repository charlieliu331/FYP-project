## Introduction

The FYP project focuses on restoring punctuation in text using different language models. The project is divided into two main sections:

- **LLM**: This section involves fine-tuning the Llama-2 model with LoRA using the LibriHeavy small dataset and comparing with the Gemini-pro performance using API.
- **pre-LLM**: This section involves using the modified XLM-RoBERTa model for punctuation restoration.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `LLM`: Contains scripts and resources for fine-tuning and testing the Llama-2 model.
- `pre-LLM`: Contains scripts and resources for using the XLM-RoBERTa model for punctuation restoration.

Please refer to the readme files in LLM and pre-LLM for more detailed instruction.
